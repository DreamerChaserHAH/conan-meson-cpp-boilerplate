# Meson Conan Cpp Template

This is merely a personal template that is to be used for my own personal projects :D. Setting up dev environments is a hassle fr, so I decided that I would make a dev environment that I can replicate on any device I am working on :D If you find it to be useful, then star it :))

## Steps

**Pre-requisite**
*Make sure you have install docker (in the system) and dev-environments extension (in vs code)*

1. Clone the repository (obviously)
2. Start by pressing F1 and search for "Reopen Project in Dev Container"
3. Wait while docker installs the necessary components
4. Happy developing

## Additional Features
Running
```
./build.sh
```
will build the current application
